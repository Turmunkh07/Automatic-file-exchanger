# Automatic image vectorizer
ðŸš€Using Python to upload files to a website and then download the files back.

ðŸ”®I will try to keep it as clean as possible and finish this project within a week (which is Before 27th August 2023 and this is a promise I'm keeping to myself. If I can't keep it, I will buy my brother a hotdogðŸŒ­)

## NOTE
ðŸ¤©It's August 25th 2023 and I've just finished the image vectorizer and it vectorizes 84 images in "TIME".
I will use APIs in the future but this does the job for now.

If you wish to use it, I would like you to notify me and star the repository. It would mean a lot.
Remember to change the path where your icons are.

## Features
Automatic Image Vectorizer uses selenium and pyautogui to open vectorizer.ai in the browser then upload my files and download them back vectorized. [what's this?] [0] [.]
