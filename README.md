# Automatic image vectorizer
🚀Using Python to upload files to a website and then download the files back.

🔮I will try to keep it as clean as possible and finish this project within a week (which is Before 27th August 2023 and this is a promise I'm keeping to myself. If I can't keep it, I will buy my brother a hotdog🌭)

## NOTE
🤩It's August 25th, 2023 and I've just finished the image vectorizer and it vectorizes 84 images in 26 minutes and 50 seconds (Keep in mind that it waits for 23 minutes and 48 seconds).
I will use APIs in the future but this does the job for now.

⚡ If I start using APIs, it will be roughly 9 times faster.

🌟If you want to use it, It'd make me happy if you notified me and starred the repository.
🖼️Remember to change the path where your icons are.

## Features
Automatic Image Vectorizer uses selenium and pyautogui to open vectorizer.ai in the browser then upload my files and download them back vectorized.
